Hi! I am a Research Scientist at the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University. I received my PhD in Physics from University of California San Diego and undergraduate and masters degree from National Tsing Hua University.
<br/><br/>
I specialize in high-energy astrophysics, solar physics, and plasma physics. My current research focuses on modeling cosmic-ray transport in the inner heliosphere and the gamma-ray emission observed by Fermi-LAT and HAWC.
