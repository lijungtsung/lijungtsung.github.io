Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University. 
<br/><br/>
I am interested in high-energy astrophysics, solar physics, and plasma physics. The focus of my current research centers on cosmic-ray transport in the inner heliosphere and modeling the gamma-ray emissions as detected by Fermi-LAT and HAWC.
