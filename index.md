Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics at The Ohio State University. 
<br/><br/>
My research interests are high-energy astrophysics, solar physics, and plasma physics. The focus of my current research centers on cosmic-ray transport in the inner heliosphere and solar atmosphere and modeling the gamma-ray emissions observed by Fermi-LAT and HAWC.
