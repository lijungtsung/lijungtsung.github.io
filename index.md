Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University.
<br/><br/>
I specialize in high-energy astrophysics, solar physics, and plasma physics. My current research focuses on modeling cosmic-ray transport in the inner heliosphere and the gamma-ray emission observed by Fermi-LAT and HAWC.
<br/><br/>
Prior to my current appointment, I was a CCAPP Postdoctoral Fellow at OSU for four years. I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California San Diego, and I hold both a B.S. and an M.S. from National Tsing Hua University.
