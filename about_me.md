## About me
<br/>
Hello! As a physicist, I'm driven by a passion to understand the plasma universe, from the intricate workings of our Sun to the vast environments of its largest structures.
<br/><br/>
My journey began in Chiayi, my hometown in southern Taiwan. I pursued both my bachelor's and master's degrees at National Tsing Hua University, where I first dove into theoretical physics by studying modified gravity and post-Newtonian expansion.
<br/><br/>
In 2014, I started my Ph.D. at the University of California San Diego. Under the guidance of Prof. George Fuller and Prof. Tongyan Lin, my research explored the "dark side" of the universe through studies of dark matter and neutrino physics.
<br/><br/>
After graduating in 2021, my path led me to The Ohio State University's Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP), where I began as a postdoctoral fellow. I am now a Research Scientist at CCAPP, and my work has shifted to the exciting challenges of solar and plasma physics, with a specialization in solar gamma rays and cosmic-ray transport.
<br/><br/>
Outside physics, I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, climbing, hiking and running marathons.
