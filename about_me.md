## About me
<br/>
Hello! I'm a research scientist with a passion for understanding the plasma astrophysics of our universe, from its largest structures to our own Sun.
<br/><br/>
My journey began in Chiayi, my hometown in southern Taiwan. I pursued both my bachelor's and master's degrees at National Tsing Hua University, where I first dove into theoretical physics by studying modified gravity and post-Newtonian expansion.
<br/><br/>
In 2014, I moved to California to pursue my Ph.D. at the University of California San Diego. My research shifted to the "dark side" of the universe, focusing on dark matter and neutrino physics under the guidance of Prof. George Fuller and Prof. Tongyan Lin.
<br/><br/>
After graduating in 2021, my path led me to The Ohio State University's Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP), where I began as a postdoctoral fellow. I am now a Research Scientist at CCAPP, and my work has shifted to the exciting challenges of solar and plasma physics, with a specialization in solar gamma rays and cosmic-ray transport.
<br/><br/>
Outside physics, I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, climbing, hiking and running marathons.
