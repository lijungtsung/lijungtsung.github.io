## About me
<br/>
My hometown is in Chiayi County in southern Taiwan. I did my undergraduate and master’s degrees at National Tsing Hua University, where I worked on modified gravity theory. I then went to California for graduate school and studied dark matter and stellar dynamics. I received my Ph.D. in Physics in 2021 from the University of California San Diego. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics at The Ohio State University.
<br/><br/>
Outside physics, I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, climbing, hiking and running marathons.
