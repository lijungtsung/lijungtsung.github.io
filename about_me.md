## About me
<br/>
Hello! I'm a research scientist with a passion for understanding the universe, from the largest cosmic structures to the plasma dynamics of our own sun.

My journey began in Chiayi, my hometown in southern Taiwan. I pursued both my bachelor's and master's degrees at National Tsing Hua University, where I first dove into theoretical physics by studying modified gravity.

Curious to explore other cosmic mysteries, I moved to California for my Ph.D. at the University of California San Diego. There, my research shifted to the invisible universe, focusing on dark matter and stellar dynamics. After graduating in 2021, I moved to the Midwest to become a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University.

My work has taken me on a journey across different scales of the universe, and I am currently excited to be tackling challenges in solar and plasma physics.

Outside physics, I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, climbing, hiking and running marathons.
