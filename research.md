#### Dark photons and BBN
Freeze-in dark photons decaying out of equilibrium and injecting entropy into the plasma during the weak-decoupling epoch results in an entropy flow between the neutrino and plasma sectors. This effect alters the time-temperature-scale factor relation and the phasing of the nuclear reactions involving light elements. In my work with G. M. Fuller and E. Groh, we calculate the freeze-in abundance of dark photon and use the code burst to trace the evolution of nucleosynthesis numerically from the beginning of weak decoupling with the presence of late-decay dark photons. Using the 1%-level primordial deuterium abundance measurements from quasar absorption lines, our result excludes a range of dark photon model parameters. Moreover, we also identify ranges of dark photon mass and couplings not yet constrained, but perhaps accessible and probable, in future Stage-4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.
