In my work with G. M. Fuller and E. Groh, we use the code BURST to trace the evolution of nucleosynthesis numerically from the beginning of weak decoupling with the presence of late-decay dark photons. Using the 1%-level primordial deuterium abundance measurements from quasar absorption lines, our result excludes a range of dark photon model parameters. Moreover, we also identify ranges of dark photon mass and couplings not yet constrained, but perhaps accessible and probable, in future Stage-4 cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.<br/><br/><br/>


### + Dark matter & plasma instability:

Milli-charged dark matter (mDM) possesses fractional electric charge and allows DM to have electromagnetic interaction with baryons. In my work with T. Lin, we provide a mechanism for a collisionless mDM to scatter efficiently with Standard Model particles. The idea is that in the frame of the expanding supernova remnant, the ambient mDM represents a beam flowing into the remnant and may drive plasma waves, which in turn scatters them. Our work reveals that the supernova shocks could sweep up and thermalize the ambient mDM via plasma instability. However, these mDM particles return to having roughly the original/ambient DM velocity in the end due to the adiabatic decompression. We also address the difficulty of getting a Fermi-accelerated mDM owing to an ultra-slow instability at the upstream of the shock. Our result implies that the detectability of terrestrial experiments to the charged DM is, in fact, not strongly affected by supernova shocks.<br/><br/><br/>

### + Gravitational waves & supermassive stars:

In my work with G. M. Fuller and C. T. Kishimoto, we investigate the formation of SMBH from the collapse of high-redshift supermassive stars and study the neutrino burst-generated gravitational waves (GW). These supermassive stars with an adiabatic index close to 4/3 suffer post-Newtonian instability at an early stage of their evolution and then collapse to black holes. During the collapses, they radiate a significant fraction of their rest mass in neutrinos. In this work, we investigated the GW signatures driven by the neutrino bursts, which create nearly unique “memory” GW signals. These signals will fall in the optimal frequency band of several upcoming space-based laser interferometer missions such as DECIGO and BBO. The result indicates that this route of SMBH formation is potentially detectable to redshifts as high as z ∼ 13, before the epoch of reionization.<br/><br/>
